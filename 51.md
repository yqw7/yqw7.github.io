* Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
* Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
* It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
* Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with numerous users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.
