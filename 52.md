## Questions
### How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by knowing how to protect themselves on the internet. It is important to know certain types of sites to avoid, as well as having different passwords for different accounts to prevent against hackers. 

### How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by sharing how to identify a dangerous website. Something I can do at Del Norte HS is by teaching my friends how to know when a website is dangerous and help them install adblockers that could prevent them from accidentally clicking onto these suspicious websites.

### Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Red tape is blocking digital empowerment by potentially blocking websites with useful information that could be used by students to learn. One barrier at Del Norte is the various websites and apps that are blocked by the school wifi. Although Reddit is essentially a social media site, there are many useful things on there such as people teaching others how to navigate the college application process [A2C](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/)
